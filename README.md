# Automation-Scripts

## Auto dataset cleaning
A script with processes all csv and excel files ad remove all null values. This is then saved in a seperate folder. This is very useful for data analysis and data science as it can process a lot of datasets in one go. Keeping the original file also keeps a track record of what has been done to the dataset and can be used to backtrack if any different operations need to be done.

## PDF to MP3

Similar to the dataset cleaning, it processes all pdf file types to a audio file. The main purpose for this script is for research papers and books and has been very useful for hearing any reports that have been personally written. Hearing back personally created documents will allow the user to detect the flow of the document which can be very important.
